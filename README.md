# TicTacToeGame
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player strategy game where opponents take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually X and O) to form a row of three in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line while trying to block their opponent from achieving the same. It's a simple yet engaging game that tests your strategic thinking and spatial awareness.
